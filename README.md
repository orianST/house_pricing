Project: Bengaluru_House_Data in India

Introduction
This project investigates the factors influencing house prices in  Bengaluru India and aims to develop accurate prediction models using regression techniques. We utilize a dataset comprising various features like location, size, and other relevant attributes.

Data Preparation
1.	Data Cleaning:
o	Missing values were identified and removed.
o	Outliers were identified and, removed.
2.	Feature Engineering:
o	Categorical features were encoded using one-hot encoding to transform them into numerical representations suitable for regression models.

Model Training and Evaluation
Three regression models were employed to create house price prediction models:
1.	Linear Regression (LR) 
2.	Random Forest Regression (RFR)
3.	Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR)

   Evaluation Metrics:
The performance of each model was evaluated using  Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared (RÂ²)

Feature Importance Analysis
Feature importance analysis was conducted to identify the features that significantly impact the prediction of house prices. This helps understand which factors buyers prioritize when considering property value.
